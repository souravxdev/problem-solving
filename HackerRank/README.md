# HackerRank Problem Solving Repository

Welcome to the **HackerRank Problem Solving** section of my competitive programming journey!  
This folder contains all **problem statements** and **solutions** organized systematically for practice tracking, documentation, and learning reference.


## Folder Structure

|  Folder   | Description                                | Link                              |
|------------|-------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| problems   | All problem statements in Markdown format | [View Problems](./problems/)      |
| solutions  | Corresponding code solutions (C / C++)    | [View Solutions](./solutions/)    |

Each problem in the `problems/` folder includes:
- A clear **problem statement**
- **Constraints**, and **examples**
- Proper **input/output** definitions  
- An **explanation** containing hints to solve   
- Problem **tags** and **author information**

Each solution in the `solutions/` folder follows:
- A clean, consistent **author signature header**
- Proper **formatting, readability**, and **efficiency**
- Focus on **logical clarity** and **competitive programming standards**


## Purpose

This collection is built to:
- Keep track of all **HackerRank problem solutions** I’ve solved in a structured way   
- Build consistency and strong problem-solving habits  
- Showcase clean, professional code structure and documentation  
- Serve as a reference for others learning programming fundamentals  


## Tech Stack

- **Languages:** C, C++  
- **Editor:** Visual Studio Code  
- **Platform:** HackerRank  


## Problems & Solutions Index

### Problems

| # | Problem Title | Problem Statement |
|---|----------------|------------------|



### Solutions

| # | Solution File | Solution Code |
|---|----------------|---------------|



### Notes
- Each problem and its solution share the same **ID** (e.g., `001`).  
- Problem statements are stored in **Markdown** for readability.  
- Solutions follow a consistent **coding standard** and **signature header format**.
