# Codeforces Problem Solving Repository

Welcome to the **Codeforces Problem Solving** section of my competitive programming journey!  
This folder contains all **problem statements** and **solutions** organized systematically for practice tracking, documentation, and reference.


## Folder Structure

|  Folder   | Description                                | Link                              |
|------------|-------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| problems   | All problem statements in Markdown format | [View Problems](./problems/)      |
| solutions  | Corresponding code solutions (C / C++)    | [View Solutions](./solutions/)    |

Each problem in the `problems/` folder includes:
- A clear **problem statement**
- **Constraints**, **examples**, and **explanations**
- Detailed **input/output** formats  
- Problem **tags**, **difficulty**, and **author information**

Each solution in the `solutions/` folder follows:
- A consistent **author signature header**
- Clean and efficient **code structure**
- Focus on **optimization**, **readability**, and **accuracy**


## Purpose

This collection is built to:
- Document all **Codeforces problems** I’ve solved in a structured way  
- Improve problem-solving consistency and competitive programming techniques  
- Showcase efficient and well-documented solutions  
- Serve as a quick reference for algorithms and patterns encountered on Codeforces  


## Tech Stack

- **Languages:** C, C++  
- **Editor:** Visual Studio Code  
- **Platform:** Codeforces  


## Problems & Solutions Index

### Problems

| # | Problem Title | Problem Statement |
|---|----------------|------------------|



### Solutions

| # | Solution File | Solution Code |
|---|----------------|---------------|




### Notes
- Each problem and its solution share the same **ID** (e.g., `001`).  
- Problem statements are written in **Markdown** for readability.  
- Solutions follow a **clean, consistent**, and **documented** format.  
- Codeforces problems are often organized by **contest and problem code** (e.g., `A_Twins`, `B_WordCapitalization`).
