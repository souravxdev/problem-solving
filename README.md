# Competitive Programming Journey

Welcome to my **Competitive Programming Repository** - a structured archive of all my solved problems, organized by platform and difficulty.  
This repository is built to document my growth, showcase clean coding standards, and share reusable problem-solving patterns with the community.


## Repository Overview

|  Platform    | Description                          | Link                           |
|--------------|--------------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| Codeforces   | Problems & solutions from Codeforces | [View Platform](./Codeforces/) |
| Hacerrank    | Problems & solutions from Hackerrank | [View Platform](./HackerRank/) |
| Phitron      | Problems & solutions from Phitron    | [View Platform](./Phitron/)    |


Each platform folder contains:
- **problems/** → problem statements in Markdown  
- **solutions/** → code implementations  
- Consistent **documentation style** across all folders  


## Goals & Purpose

This repository aims to:
- Maintain a **clean record** of all solved problems.  
- Develop deep understanding of **algorithms and data structures**.  
- Practice writing **professional, readable, and efficient code**.  
- Build a **public portfolio** of my problem-solving skills.


## Tech Stack

- **Languages:** C | C++ 
- **Editor:** Visual Studio Code  
- **Version Control:** Git & GitHub  
- **Platforms:** Codeforces | Hackerrank | Phitron 


## Contribution Guidelines

While this is primarily a **personal learning repository**, you’re welcome to:
- Open **issues** for corrections or suggestions.  
- Create **pull requests** to improve formatting or efficiency.  
- Share feedback on **code readability and design patterns**.


## Learning Focus

- Data Structures (Arrays, Linked Lists, Trees, Graphs)  
- Algorithms (Sorting, Searching, Dynamic Programming, Greedy)  
- Problem-Solving Patterns (Recursion, Backtracking, Simulation)  
- Competitive Optimization (Time & Space Complexity)
